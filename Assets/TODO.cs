    when enemy uses a status move on self, the playerHit animation is still played
        (same when player uses status move on self, enemyHit animation is played)

    when a trainer's facing is changed in the inspector, their FOV does not rotate correctly when set to UP

    trainer will walk diagonally to reach the player (is check for trainerbattle happenning too early?)

    SpriteFader is broken (used in BattleSystem.ThrowCapsule())

    Saving system in PlayerController is not setting player facing in character for some reason

    capsules are not always being deducted from their count after being used

    Player is weirdly offset from the grid.  Has to do with Character.OffsetY and SetPositionAndSnapToTile() in Awake()

    NPCs are weirdly offset vertically.  Has to do with SetPositionAndSnapToTile() in Awake();
