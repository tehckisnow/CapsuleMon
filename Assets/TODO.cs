    //when enemy uses a status move on self, the playerHit animation is still played

    //trainer will walk diagonally to reach the player (is check for trainerbattle happenning too early?)

    //SpriteFader is broken (used in BattleSystem.ThrowCapsule())

    //Saving system in PlayerController is not setting player facing in character for some reason

    //capsules are not always being deducted from their count after being used

    //when a trainer's facing is changed in the inspector, their FOV does not rotate correctly when set to UP
    
    //Player is weirdly offset from the grid.  Has to do with Character.OffsetY and SetPositionAndSnapToTile() in Awake()

    //NPCs are weirdly offset vertically.  Has to do with SetPositionAndSnapToTile() in Awake();

    //problem with healing party

    quest pickup revive is not persistent if the scene it is in is unloaded before the game is saved

    get stuck on item screen when try to use an item in no battle when there are no items

    confirm that moves like growl are adjusting attack correctly and attack is being factored in correctly

    confirm that 

    //-hide trainer sprite after trainerBattle (or at beginning of wildMonBattle) (I think this is fixed)
    
    //-battlescreen dialog overlaps choices (I think this is fixed)


    ---Features---

    also skip in battle dialog

    //being able to set the player's name would be nice

    yes/no confirmation menu would be nice
